# Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute! You can contribute via simply opening Issues reporting bugs or requesting features.

## Pull Request Contributions

The best way to contribute is by doing a Pull Request that fixes a bug or implements a new feature.

However, before opening the PR, consider first discussing the change you wish to make via an issue, so that a good design can be discussed.

To make a good PR, follow these steps:

1. Ensure all tests pass locally before starting the pull request.
2. Add adequate description in the Pull Request, or cite the corresponding issue if one exists by using `#` and the issue number.
3. Always allow the "editing from maintainers" option in your PR.
4. Update the CHANGELOG.md with details of the (notable) changes to the exported API.
5. Feel free to explicitly tag (with `@`) one of the maintainers to request a review of your PR when it is ready.
