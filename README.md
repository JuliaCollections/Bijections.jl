Julia dictionaries are not one-to-one. That is, two different keys might have the same value.
A `Bijection` data structure behaves just like a dictionary, except it prevents the assignment of the same value to two different keys.

See [the documentation](https://JuliaCollections.github.io/Bijections.jl/stable/) for more details.

See [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for a version history.
